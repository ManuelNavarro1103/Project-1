# Project-1.

Project 1  is a complete reimbursement application with employee and manager functionality. 

# Employee.

Employees are assigned a login in which they are able to login and view all of their past tickets. They are also able to create a new reimbursement ticket based on their needs and then wait for approval by a manager. Employees can use either of these features unlimitedly until they choose to logout.

# Manager.

Managers are also assigned a login and are prompted to sign in like an employee, but there is a backend check to check if they are a manager which they will then be taken to the manager landing page. As a manager they will have all the features of an employee with additional features. The manager may view all pending tickets and approve or deny them. The manager may also query all tickets and sort them by pending, rejected, or approved.
